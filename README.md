Place to save configs and use with fork of [LARBS](https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/LARBS) to restore my environment

Additionally it has two scripts:

  - `collect.sh` - to sync all configs in `list` from the system and commit to github
  - `spread.sh` - to sync all configs in `list` from github repo clone to the system
